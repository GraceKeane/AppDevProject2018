            <Label Text="The Badger is the largest terrestrial omnivore in Ireland. It is instantly recognisable by its white head and dark stripes through its eyes. Badgers are powerfully built with a relatively small head, short thick neck, short muscular legs and a bushy tail. They are widespread throughout Ireland but being secretive and nocturnal, they are seldom encountered in the wild. Badgers diet on Earthworms, Insects, Grubs, the eggs of ground-nesting birds and also roots and fruit."
